📘 **General** -->
The program for writing administrative form templates is written in the C language. It is simple and mainly serves as a sample, not too complex. It includes basic algorithmic operations such as writing, reading, and adding text.

📘 **Standard** -->
The program standardizes words entered by the user. It can convert uppercase to lowercase and vice versa. If the user inputs text in a messy or incorrect format, it can be normalized.

📘 **Text** -->
The program manages basic student information using structs. For more complex implementations, Java can be used for support.
