The program for writing administrative form templates is written in the C language. It is simple and mainly serves as a sample, not too complex. It includes basic algorithmic operations such as writing, reading, and adding text.
The program standardizes words entered by the user. It can convert uppercase to lowercase and vice versa. If the user inputs text in a messy or incorrect format, it can be normalized.
The program manages basic student information using structs. For more complex implementations, Java can be used for support.
